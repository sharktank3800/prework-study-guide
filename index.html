        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li> Elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements. If there are three elements nested inside of a body element, 
               those three nested elements are known as child elements.
               The element that holds all the children—in this case, the body element—is known as the parent element.</li>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage.</li>
          <li>The head element contains  information or metadata that helps the browser to render the page correctly.</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li>
          <li>The head element plays a role as a container of metadata and the meta tags contains information about the page that is used by the browser.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>An HTML attribute defines additional information about an element.</li>
          <li>The metadata tags are always inside the head element</li>
          <li>Inside head element the title element which is a metadata tag defines the title for a webpage this element is required and is extremely important for search engine optimization (seo)</li>
          <li>Inside head element the style element which is a metadata tag defines the css styles associated with a website </li>
          <li>Inside head element the link element which is a metadata tag connects an external resource to the html document</li>
          <li>Inside head element the meta element which is a metadat tag defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport</li>
          <ul>
            <li>The charset attribute sets our character encoding.</li>
            <li>The http-equiv attribute sets an HTTP header for content.</li>
            <li>The viewport attribute sets the default view for our webpage.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Inside head element the script element which is a metadata tag embeds client-side scripts in the html document.</li>
          <li>An element refers to the entire element from opening tag to closing tag, 
            whereas a tag refers only to what appears inside the angle brackets.</li>
            <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
            <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list item.</li>
            <li>The img element can contain various attributes; the src attribute is the most important because it defines the location of the image.</li>
            <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
            <li>The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages. The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
            <li>The header appears at the top of the page and usually contains a navigation menu and/or introductory content.</li>
            <li>The footer appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>
            <li>In semantic HTML elements, the name of the element describes its content and the role it plays on a webpage.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>style an element directly in the HTML file, they use inline CSS. 
            Inline styles apply to a specific HTML tag, using a style attribute with a CSS rule to style a particular page element only.
            They are useful for quick and permanent changes but are less flexible than external and internal style sheets, 
            because each inline style must be edited individually whenever you make a design change.</li>
          <li>It is also possible to embed an entire stylesheet directly in the HTML file using a style element in the head element. 
              This internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file. The rules only apply to that page, and you can configure CSS classes and IDs, which are used to identify elements, to style multiple elements in the page code. 
              Again, a single change to the CSS rule will apply to all tagged page elements.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS and internal style sheets are totally acceptable methods under certain conditions, but the most common way to style a webpage is by using an external CSS style sheet. 
              This is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
              <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
              <li>A selector defines the element or attributes to which the rules, or declarations, will apply.</li>
              <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
              <li>A margin property indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
              <li> The padding property adds space around the content inside an element. 
                   When you increase padding, you are actually making the entire element bigger.</li>
              <li>it is important to know that every HTML element is essentially a box. Each box consists of margins outside the element, and the element's borders, padding, and content. This is sometimes referred to as the CSS box model.</li>
              <li>We combined two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors.</li>
              <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
         <h2>GIT</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>version control systems can save the day! Version control systems allow us to track and manage changes to our codebase.
              That way, if we need to make changes or even revert back to an earlier copy, we can do so without losing other versions of our code.</li>
          <li> Using version control, then, not only allows us to track our progress in our code development, 
               but also keeps the different, older versions in safe-keeping, in case we need to revert if a mistake is made.</li>
          <li>to collaborate with others, you need to use another tool, GitHub.</li>
          <li>Git is version control software and GitHub is a 
              cloud-based service that hosts our repositories which is where the project code will live.</li>
          <li>Git commands always start with git and are used to save and track versions of your code. Using Git commands,
              we can initiate (or create) a repo, add our code to the repo, and view the different versions of our code, which are each stored in a unique commit.</li>
          <li>Repository (repo) — a folder in which all files and their version histories are stored.</li>
          <li>Branch — a workspace in which you can make changes that wont affect the live site.</li>
          <li>Markdown (.md) — a way to write in Github that converts plain text to GitHub code. Sites such as Atom and Sublime Text are examples of free resources for developers using Markdown.</li>
          <li>Commit Changes — a saved record of a change made to a file within the repo.</li>
          <li>Pull Request (PR) — the way to ask for changes made to a branch to be merged into another branch that also allows for multiple users to see, discuss and review work being done.</li>
          <li>Merge — after a pull request is approved, the commit will be pulled in (or merged) from one branch to another and then, deployed on the live site.</li>
          <li>Issues — how work is tracked when using git. Issues allow users to report new tasks and content fixes, as well as allows users to track progress on a project board from beginning to end of a specific project.</li>
        </ul>

          <li> A function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>JavaScript was designed to add interactivity to HTML pages</li>

          <li>JavaScript variables are used to hold values or expressions.</li>
          <li> a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>Using JavaScript, you can power your websites with effects, interactivity, data communication, and much more.</li>
          <li>control flow- the order in which a computer executes code in a javascript file.</li>
          <li>After the var keyword, we give the variable a name. This name must be unique because it is how we will reference the information stored in the variable in our code.</li>
          <li> All strings are surrounded by quotation marks.</li>
          <li>Let's take a closer look at console.log. The word console refers to a test environment that developers use to check out their code. The second part, .log(), is a method, which means a set of instructions that can be executed by a computer.</li>
